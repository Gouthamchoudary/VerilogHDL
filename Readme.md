# Verilog Code Repository

This repository contains various Verilog codes from half adders to flipflops from EC331 course.

# Synthesis of Digital Systems

## Directory Structure
Each component, like a half adder, has its own dedicated folder. Inside that folder, you will find all the related files for that specific component.

//test bench is not included, its a waste of time!

Here is an example of the directory structure  a single component:


```
half_adder/
├── half_adder.v        # Verilog source code
├── half_adder_tb.v     # Verilog testbench
├── half_adder.png       # Schematic diagram of the circuit
├── truth_table.md      # Truth table for the component
└── waveform.png        # Resulting waveform from the testbench simulation
```
